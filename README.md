# QKSMS Issue Tracker

This is a public issue tracker for QKSMS. [View the open issues](https://github.com/qklabs/qksms-tracker/issues).

Also feel free to check out our [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104505769539048913485) to watch for announcements and updates.

### Organization

We accept two kinds of feedback: bug reports and enhancements. Bug reports identify problems in current functionality, and enhancements are new functionality.

#### Bug reports
A great bug report contains a description of the problem and steps to reproduce the problem. We need to know what we're looking for and where to look for it. If the QKSMS team can't reproduce a bug, we will work with testers to fix the problem.

Bugs are given the red `bug` label. Bugs also may be given extra orange labels:

`needs-info`: We need a better description of the problem.  
`needs-repro`: We need someone who can reproduce the issue consistently.  
`needs-review`: We need someone to verify that the bug has been squashed.

##### Example bug report submission
> *This is a real bug as of the time of writing. Try reproducing it!*

```
