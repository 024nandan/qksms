# QKSMS Issue Tracker

This is a public issue tracker for QKSMS. [View the open issues](https://github.com/qklabs/qksms-tracker/issues).

Also feel free to check out our [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104505769539048913485) to watch for announcements and updates.

### How to help

1. Report bugs
2. Help reproduce bugs
3. Make enhancement requests (it would be great if QKSMS...)

#### Reporting bugs
A great bug report contains a description of the problem and steps to reproduce the problem. We need to know what we're looking for and where to look for it. If the QKSMS team can't reproduce a bug, we will work with testers to fix the problem.

Bugs are given the red `bug` label. Bugs also may be given extra orange labels:

`needs-info`: We need a better description of the problem.  
`needs-repro`: We need someone who can reproduce the issue consistently.  
`needs-review`: We need someone to verify that the bug has been squashed.

##### Example bug report submission
> *This is a real bug as of the time of writing. Try reproducing it!*

```
### DESCRIPTION
Conversations aren't marked as read when they are opened from a notification.

### STEPS
1. Long press on a conversation and press "Mark as unread" to reveal a notification.
2. Press the home button to put QKSMS in the background.
3. Pull down on the notification to open the notification drawer.
4. Tap on the body of the notification (not the buttons).
5. Tap on the back button to reveal the conversation list.

### EXPECTED
The conversation is marked as read.

### REALITY
The conversation isn't marked as read.

#### Helping reproduce bugs
Reproducing a bug is important, since if we can't reproduce an issue then it's hard to figure out what's going wrong, and we can't know that we've fixed it. 

To see bugs that need "repro steps", go to the Issues section and search for `is:open label:needs-repro`. If you see any bugs that you know how to reproduce (see above for example repro steps), then make a comment with the steps and we'll track the bug down!

#### Making enhancement requests
There are no rules for enhancement requests. Your ideas are all awesome. Although we may not implement every suggestion, we love brainstorming with you and hearing your feedback.

To make an enhancement request, add an "issue" with the "enhancement" label.
